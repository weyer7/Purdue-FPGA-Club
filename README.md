## Project Paths
For **Spring 2025**, the club offers the following two project paths:

### 1. 270 FPGA Development Board
- **Objective**: Design and prototype a new low-cost FPGA board for Purdue’s ECE 270 class.  
- **Tools**: KiCad (for PCB design and layout).  
- **Goal**: Deliver a working prototype by the semester's end.  
- **Support**: Subteam members will receive guidance in learning the tools and debugging/design processes.

### 2. Digital Design Project
- **Objective**: Collaborate in small teams (about 4 members) to create an FPGA project for the **ECE Spark Competition**.  
- **Examples**:
  - A **MIDI synthesizer** that processes music signals to generate sound output for headphones.  
  - A **snake game** where buttons control the speed or direction of the snake.  
- **Project Suggestions Forum**: Members can pitch ideas and form teams based on shared interests.

## Getting Started
1. **Join a Project Path**: Choose between the 270 FPGA Development Board or Digital Design Project subteams.  
2. **Participate in Meetings**: Stay updated via the announcements channel.  
3. **Use the Lab**: Ensure you’ve attended at least one meeting before using the lab equipment.
